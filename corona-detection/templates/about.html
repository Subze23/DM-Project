            <h2>COVID-19 Detector</h2>
            <p style="color: white;">COVID-19 is a viral disease that in the form of a pandemic has spread in the entire world, causing a severe impact on people's well being. In fighting against this deadly disease, a pivotal step can prove to be an effective screening and diagnosing step to treat infected patients. This can be made possible through the use of chest X-ray images. Early detection of the disease using chest X-ray images can prove to be a key solution in fighting against COVID-19. In this, our idea is to creating a website which detects the covid infection using chest x-ray. This site provides a well defined user interface using html and CSS and our model for the prediction is trained with the publicly available COVID-19 dataset using CNN(Convolution  Neural Network), which produces an accuracy around 90 percent.</p>
